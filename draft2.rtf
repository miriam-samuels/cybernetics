\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I like to think (and\
the sooner the better!)\
of a cybernetic meadow\
where mammals and computers\
live together in mutually\
programming harmony\
like pure water\
touching clear sky.\
\
I like to think\
(right now, please!)\
of a cybernetic forest\
filled with pines and electronics\
where deer stroll peacefully\
past computers\
as if they were flowers\
with spinning blossoms.\

\cf2 I like to think\
(it has to be!)\
of a cybernetic ecology\
where we are free of our labors\
and joined back to nature,\
returned to our mammal\
brothers and sisters,\
and all watched over\
by machines of loving grace.}
